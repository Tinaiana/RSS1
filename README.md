that is a rss that i wrote the code by java and the help of https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
if you enter 1 you can add a uml and if that uml already exists it tells you that it exists and
if you enter 2 you can remove a uml and of it does not exist it tells you that it doesnot exist and
if you enter number 3 it shows you all the uml existing and 
number 4 is for exiting the program 
also any time you run it again you have your umls saved
